## This is a REST API 
It is a subscriberDB server
```bash  To run use: npm run devstart ```The entry point is server.js 
    

The .env and node_modules are in the .gitignore folder
You need to create them after you have cloned the repo. 
Create a .env file and put the mongodb connection string.


## Usage/Examples
```javascriptExample: DATABASE_URL = mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/acme
To install packages and node_modules use the command:
npm install 
The subscribersDB server can allow you to
GET, POST, PATCH AND DELETE```
